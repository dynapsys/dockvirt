# ✅ `dockvirt heal` added – runs self-healing routines (default network, images map, logging)
# ✅ `scripts/fix_permissions.py --apply` – applies ACL/SELinux fixes for ~/.dockvirt
# ✅ Agent improved: waits for HTTP readiness and sends Host header to Caddy

# ✅ WORKING: Testing and validation
make repair                    # Command validation works
make install                   # Package installation works

# ✅ WORKING: Help and info commands
dockvirt --help               # Shows help
dockvirt up --help           # Shows subcommand help

# ❌ NEEDS DEPENDENCIES: System check
dockvirt check               # Will work after installing libvirt

# 📝 AFTER FIXING DEPENDENCIES:
dockvirt up                  # Will work with .dockvirt file
```
